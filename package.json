  "description": "I wanted to see if it was possible to programmatically run searches against FINRA's Brokercheck database for academic purposes (learning to work with APIs). I didn't see any documentation for their API, so I figured I'd try my hand at making my own sort of wrapper for their search tool. The goal is for a user to be able to run queries using the BrokerCheck API to look up Firms as well as Registered and Licensed Reps.",
